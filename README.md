# History of Jazz 3
Jazz Jackrabbit 3D was the sequel to Jazz Jackrabbit 2 (duh) and started by Eclipse Productions as a unofficial project after Jazz Jackrabbit 2's release, running under the Unreal 1 engine. Later on, it was developed by World Tree Games and Jagged Edge Studios (Epic didn't have very much involvement with it). When Epic was shown the project, they were very impressed, however, they could not find a publisher for it, killing the project.

# Builds
This archive has two builds. One is a alpha build dating back to November 17, 1999. 

The second is a earlier build that was discovered in 2017. It uses the 224 verison of the Unreal engine.

These are janky alpha builds, so don't expect them to work. :P

This archive does NOT contain the fan patch. You can get it [here](https://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19325) though!
